This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. run `nvm use` to run the right version of nodejs
2. run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. now you can run the dev server by running `npm run dev`
4. if you want websockets running, you'll need to do the following in another terminal window:
    - `cd worker`
    - `npm run dev`

## Editor setup

This project uses [biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting/formatting.
